## Introduction

This repository contains Python implementations of common data structures and algorithms. Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in its own file with detailed comments and example usage. The aim is to help developers understand the inner workings of these concepts and how to implement them in Python.

## Installation

To use the data structures and algorithms in this repository, you can clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Debaraj-stha/dsa-in-python.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd dsa
```

## Usage

Each data structure and algorithm is contained in its own file. To use a data structure or algorithm, import the relevant class or function into your Python script. For example, to use the `LinkedList` class:

```python
from linked_list import LinkedList

# Example usage
ll = LinkedList()
ll.append(10)
ll.append(20)
ll.display()
```

To use a sorting algorithm, import the function you need:

```python
from sorting_algorithms import insertion_sort

my_list = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
insertion_sort(my_list)
print(my_list)
```

Refer to the individual files for more detailed usage examples.

## Data Structures

### Arrays

Arrays are a fundamental data structure consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by an index.

- **File**: `array_1.py`

### Linked Lists

Linked lists are a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, with each element (node) pointing to the next element in the sequence.

- **File**: `linked_list.py`

### Stacks

Stacks are a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. The most recently added element is the first one to be removed.

- **File**: `stack.py`

### Queues

Queues are a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. The first element added is the first one to be removed.

- **File**: `queue.py`

### Trees

Trees are a hierarchical data structure with a root node and child nodes, represented as a set of linked nodes.

- **File**: `tree.py`

### Graphs

Graphs are a collection of nodes connected by edges. They can be used to represent various real-world structures.

- **File**: `graph.py`

### Hash Tables

Hash tables are a data structure that implements an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values efficiently.

- **File**: `hash_table.py`

### Heaps

Heaps are a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a max heap, for any given node I, the value of I is greater than or equal to the values of its children.

- **File**: `heap.py`

## Design and Analysis of Algorithms

### Searching

#### Linear Search

Linear searching (also known as sequential searching) examines each element of the list one by one until the target value is found or the end of the list is reached.

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Average: O(n)
  - Best: O(1)
  - Worst: O(n)

#### Binary Search

Binary search is a highly efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Average: O(log n)
  - Best: O(1)
  - Worst: O(log n)

### Sorting

#### Insertion Sort

Insertion sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Average: O(n^2)
  - Best: O(n)
  - Worst: O(n^2)

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

#### Selection Sort

Selection sort selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion and moves it to the end of the sorted portion.

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Average: O(n^2)
  - Best: O(n^2)
  - Worst: O(n^2)

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

#### Bubble Sort

Bubble sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Average: O(n^2)
  - Best: O(n)
  - Worst: O(n^2)

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

#### Heap Sort

Heap sort uses a binary heap data structure. It builds a max heap and then extracts the maximum element to build the sorted list.

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Average: O(n log n)
  - Best: O(n log n)
  - Worst: O(n log n)

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

#### Merge Sort

Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the list into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Average: O(n log n)
  - Best: O(n log n)
  - Worst: O(n log n)

- **Space Complexity**: O(n)

#### Quick Sort

Quick sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks a pivot and partitions the list into elements less than and greater than the pivot, then recursively sorts the partitions.

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Average: O(n log n)
  - Best: O(n log n)
  - Worst: O(n^2) (depends on pivot selection)

- **Space Complexity**: O(log n) (for the recursion stack)
